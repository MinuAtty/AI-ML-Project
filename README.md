Scenario overview  
As people increasingly use digital devices like smartphones and smartwatches to access sensitive information, 
such as online payments and banking, it's crucial to have an enhanced authentication method that continuously 
and transparently safeguards user data from unauthorized access. This assessment seeks to evaluate 
acceleration-based features and explore their potential for verifying user identity through neural networks.
